# RecoveRiver-Mobile-App

In this repo you can see a snapshot of the mental health React Native app I created for my master thesis. 
The project involved designing and creating the mobile application in collaboration wiht a clinical psychologists team. 
The application consists of multiple exercises which aim to provide support to patients with eating disorders (and this application was a part of a clinical study, hence, the exercises are specific to research hypothesis). 

RecoveRiver consists of pages including mindfulness meditation videos, notes taking sections, rating one's mood on a scale, reading, entering answers and reviewing user progress. 

The app have a sentiment analysis module implemented within it which analyzes user's text input and indicated what mood they might be in. Based on that a selection of specific to mood exercises is displayed to the user.
